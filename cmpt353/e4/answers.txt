1.) Based on your results for the last question, do you think
daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density?
Briefly explain why or why not.

If it is okay to get the prediction within 1000 people/km^2, then predicting that
population density is within 1000-4000 people/km^2 when temperature is between 15 to 30
degrees is okay. But, for a more accurate prediction I believe using a different
parameter other than temperature, such as distance from major port,
might produce a better trend to make a more accurate prediction.


2.) The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed on
disk throughout the analysis. Decompressing every time we run
the program seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working
with an uncompressed .json data?

gzip significantly reduces repeated words and characters in a file, therefore
creating a much smaller file. Loading a smaller file is much faster than a smaller
one, therefore improving performance
