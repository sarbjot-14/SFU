1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to
being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the
ratings are increasing?

  Residuals are not normal. The histogram is skewed left.
  Can not conclude anything because residuals is not normal.

2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter
do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

  It is hard to see a difference, but I would trust the new prediction more because
  it has been trained on the data we are working with whereas previously we
  made our best educated guess of what the tempertures might behave like. Using
  the coefficent from the trained model will be able to better predict and
  smooth data more accurately.
