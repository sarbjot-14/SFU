1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task?
kNN classifer
Can you give a theory about why?

I don't think Bayes classifier did well because it relies on probabilities
derived from Bayes Theorem. There isn't much of trends or patterens to guess
probabilities, therefore it we less successful compared to others

I believe k nearest neighbors did well because colours are naturally grouped
and concentreated then blend into different colours. Finding the nearest neighbours
makes sense in order to find the closest color to the target.

SVM works best when there is a large margin between segments. Since colour is
continues and does not have clear cut segments SVM would not be optimal here



2. Have a look at the cities in your validation data where
the weather model makes the wrong prediction. Do you feel like
the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather
features that we could potentially add to make better predictions?

I think the wrong predictions are reasonable. The cities mistakenly predicted
are either geographically very close, or simply have very similar weather. Perhaps
using the date of the first and last snowfall for the year would help increase
accuracy.
