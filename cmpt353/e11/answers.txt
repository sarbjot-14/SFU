1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()?
Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.
(No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

  I cached the data that is first read into the program (comments dataframe) because it is used to groupby
  to get averages and it is used to join.

  I also cached relative dataframe because it is used to find max relative scores and also used
  to join in the step to match authors with the relative max scores.

2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the
“best author” program above?

  with broadcast: 42.2 seconds

  without broacast: 50 seconds

  Performed 16% faster with broadcast.
