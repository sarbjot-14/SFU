1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation
data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept?
What is the type, and describe the values.

Panda series where each element is a float64.

The values are the rating scores for the best fit line.

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?

Since we have the slope and intercept of the fit line by using linear regression
method, we then multiply the slope with the each timestamp to get the amount it increases. Then
adding the intercept.


Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make
points on the plot?


Each date will line up with each rating because pandas does element wise operations,
therefore element by element the two series match up and is able create points that
emulate reality.
